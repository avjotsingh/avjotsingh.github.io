I am a graduate student in the department of Computer Science at `Stony Brook University`, where I am specializing in computer systems. My interests span across the entire computing stack, including **computer architecutre**, **operating systems**, **database systems**, **distributed systems**, **computer networking**, **compilers**, and **security**. I am an aspiring systems guru, and hence I am expanding my knowledge in the above areas by taking relevant courses that comprise a mix of theoretical and hands-on training in addition to reading technical papers and blogs. 

I also have `4 years` of industry experience as a software engineer, having worked at both a tech giant, `Cisco`, and a FinTech startup, `Clear`. At Cisco, I was responsible for architecting, implementing, and monitoring large-scale data processing pipelines processing terabytes of data per day. At Clear, I worked as a full-stack developer to improve the overall user experience of the company's tax filing platform.

This site serves as a collection of my work, including project documentation, summaries of papers I have read, blog posts, my CV, and contact information. I plan to keep it as updated as possible.

Outside of classes, you'll often find me at the gym, trying out new recipes, or unwinding with a good Netflix series.
